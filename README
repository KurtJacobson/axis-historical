ABOUT AXIS
==========

AXIS is a front-end for EMC with file preview and live plot.

The AXIS user interface is intended to be self-documenting by use of
familiar controls and plain language on tooltips and menus.  A few less
evident features are documented by Help > Quick Reference.

Python 2.2 or newer with Tkinter is required.  Hardware accelerated
OpenGL is nice, but not required.

AXIS is compatible with emc1 and emc2.

AXIS's home page is http://axis.unpythonic.net/


INSTALLATION
============

In the AXIS source directory, run the installer as root:
    $ env EMCROOT=/xxx python setup.py install

For EMC1, EMCROOT is the absolute path to the directory where the "emc" and
"rcslib" directories reside.  For EMC1, you may also be required to give
the value for PLAT, the non-realtime platform that EMC is configured to
use.  In this case, the commandline would look like
    $ env EMCROOT=/xxx PLAT=yyy python setup.py install

For EMC2, EMCROOT is the absolute path to the "emc" directory.
It is not necessary to specify PLAT for EMC2.

To make EMC actually use AXIS as the front-end, find the "DISPLAY" line
in your ini file.  Change it to read "DISPLAY = axis".
