AXIS's home page is
    http://axis.unpythonic.net/
The current CVS tree can be viewed at
    http://unpy.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/axis/
though it may be integrated into the EMC2 tree at some future time.

AXIS is a front-end for EMC with file preview and live plot.  Use it by
specifing "DISPLAY = axis" in your inifile.

The AXIS user interface is intended to be mostly self-documented by its
use of familiar controls and plain English tooltips and menus.  A few less
evident features are documented with basic built-in help screens.

Python 2.2 or newer with Tkinter, BLT, and PyOpenGL are required.  Hardware
accelerated OpenGL is nice, but not required.


For installation on an RPM-based system such as Red Hat or Fedora, cd to
the axis source directory and run something like:
    $ env EMCROOT=xxx python setup.py bdist_rpm
    $ sudo rpm -ivh dist/axis*.i386.rpm

For installation without using RPM or on non-RPM systems, cd to the axis
source directory and run:
    $ env EMCROOT=xxx python setup.py install

In the above commands, EMCROOT is the directory where the "emc" and
"rcslib" directories reside.  If you are building for EMC1, you may also
be required to give the value for PLAT, the non-realtime platform that EMC
is configured to use.  In this case, the commandline would look like
    $ env EMCROOT=xxx PLAT=yyy python setup.py install
