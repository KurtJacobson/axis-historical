NEEDED for 1.0
* don't let GUI go directly from spindle CCW to CW (grey out button?)
* all keystrokes
* set relative coordinate offsets (right-click on axis in xemc)
* limit override 
* pick better Z-buffer extents using machine limits from inifile

Known Bugs
* jog buttons don't work if you tab to them and use the space bar
* (feature?) f-key actions can be done from MDI tab
* ctrl-k doesn't work in MDI tab
* double tap on jog with increment will jog between 1 and 2 increments

Wishlist items
* messages when paused (or about to pause) should offer the opportunity to
  unpause in the dialog
* make step button work from program beginning (if possible?)
* improve opengl navigation
* Way to show diameter of drills, width of cuts (poor-man's CSG preview)
* Way to turn off lines already plotted in live preview
* context menu on code area, options "copy", "start at this line"
* make the view follow the cone around
* more built-in help
* for live plot, G0 vs G1 should be different colors
* file open dialog should remember the directory from previous open
* file open's initial default directory should be read from the ini

Missing dialogs/subwindows from xemc:
* tool list editor (at least display?)
* axis editor
* coordinate systems
* calibration, logging, variables, diagnostics
