BUGS
State of "copy" and "set next line"

NEEDED for public beta release
* most important keystrokes
* check that it fits on 800x600 BDI, or shorten text widget

NEEDED for 1.0
* use real rs274 parser instead of homebrew
* install axis in emc's plat bin directory
* all keystrokes
* toggle machine/commanded, relative/absolute coordinates
* show coordinate stuff in status bar
* set relative coordinate offsets (right-click on axis in xemc)
* limit override 

Wishlist items
* make step button work from program beginning (if possible?)
* improve opengl navigation
* Way to show diameter of drills, width of cuts (poor-man's CSG preview)
* Way to turn off lines already plotted in live preview
* context menu on code area, options "copy", "start at this line"
* make the view follow the cone around
* remove use of GLUT for fonts.  remove import of GLUT.
* axis speed (jogging) XXX feed rate already affects jog speed inside emc, is this actually necessary?

Missing dialogs/subwindows from xemc:
* tool list editor (at least display?)
* axis editor
* coordinate systems
* calibration, logging, variables, diagnostics
