NEEDED for public beta release
* update README file

NEEDED for 1.0
* feed override limit of 1.2 (120%) should come from inifile?
* re-word emergency stop, machine power menu items, tooltips, key reference
* don't let GUI go directly from spindle CCW to CW (grey out button?)
* use real rs274 parser instead of homebrew (get rid of separate validate)
* install axis in emc's plat bin directory
* all keystrokes
* toggle machine/commanded, relative/absolute coordinates
* show coordinate stuff in status bar
* set relative coordinate offsets (right-click on axis in xemc)
* limit override 

Wishlist items
* make step button work from program beginning (if possible?)
* improve opengl navigation
* Way to show diameter of drills, width of cuts (poor-man's CSG preview)
* Way to turn off lines already plotted in live preview
* context menu on code area, options "copy", "start at this line"
* make the view follow the cone around
* axis speed (jogging) XXX feed rate already affects jog speed inside emc, is this actually necessary?

Missing dialogs/subwindows from xemc:
* tool list editor (at least display?)
* axis editor
* coordinate systems
* calibration, logging, variables, diagnostics

Missing keys (XEmc)
